## 1. Introduction to DevOps
- **What Is DevOps:** DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

- **History of DevOps:** DevOps emerged as a response to the challenges of traditional software development methodologies. It gained popularity as organizations realized the need for collaboration between development and operations teams.

- **DevOps Definition:** DevOps is often defined as a culture, a set of practices, or a combination of both. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, measurement, and sharing (CAMS).

- **DevOps and Software Development Life Cycle:** DevOps principles are applied throughout the software development life cycle, from planning and coding to testing, deployment, and monitoring.

- **Waterfall Model:** The Waterfall model is a traditional software development approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. It lacks flexibility.

- **Agile Model:** Agile is an iterative and flexible software development approach that allows for changes and collaboration throughout the development process.

- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (Jenkins):** Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. Jenkins is a popular CI tool that automates building, testing, and deploying applications.

- **Containers and Virtual Development (Docker, Vagrant):** Containers like Docker provide a consistent environment for applications to run, making development and deployment more predictable. Vagrant is used for creating and managing virtualized development environments.

- **Configuration Management Tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef):** Configuration management tools automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure. Ansible, Puppet, and Chef are popular choices.

## 2. Continuous Integration - Jenkins
- **Introduction to Jenkins:** Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for building, testing, and deploying code changes.

- **Continuous Integration with Jenkins:** Jenkins automates the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository. For example, when a developer commits code, Jenkins can automatically build and test the code.

- **Configure Jenkins:** Jenkins can be configured to work with various programming languages, version control systems, and build tools.

- **Jenkins Management:** Jenkins provides a web-based interface for managing jobs, plugins, and nodes (machines where jobs run).

- **Scheduling Build Jobs:** You can schedule Jenkins to run build jobs at specific times or in response to code changes.

## 3. Containers and Virtual Development - Docker
- **Docker Image:** A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

- **Docker Installation:** Docker can be installed on various operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and macOS.

- **Working with Docker Containers:** Docker containers are instances of Docker images. They are isolated and run consistently across different environments.

- **Docker Command Line Interface:** Docker provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing containers and images.

- **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define your application's services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file.

- **Docker Hub:** Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that hosts Docker images. It's a repository for sharing and distributing Docker images.

- **Docker Trusted Registry:** Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) is a secure image storage solution that integrates with Docker Enterprise Edition.

- **Docker Swarm:** Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a swarm of Docker nodes.

- **Docker Attach:** Docker attach allows you to attach to a running container's process.

- **Docker File & Commands:** Dockerfiles are used to create Docker images. They contain instructions for building the image step by step.

## 4. Configuration Management Tools - Ansible
- **Introduction to Ansible:** Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.

- **Ansible Server Configuration:** Ansible requires a control node (server) from which automation is performed.

- **Infrastructure Management:** Ansible can manage infrastructure by defining desired states in playbooks.

- **SSH Connection in Ansible Master:** Ansible uses SSH to connect to remote hosts and execute tasks.

- **YAML Scripts:** Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format. They define the tasks to be executed.

- **Host Inventory:** Ansible uses host inventory files to define hosts and groups of hosts.

- **Ad-hoc Commands:** Ansible allows for the execution of single commands on remote hosts without writing playbooks.

- **Playbooks:** Playbooks are the foundation for executing tasks in Ansible. They can include variables, conditionals, loops, and handlers.

- **Modules:** Ansible provides a variety of modules for performing tasks on remote hosts. Core modules are built-in, and extra modules can be added.

- **Ansible Role:** An Ansible role is a way to organize tasks, variables, and handlers into reusable components.
